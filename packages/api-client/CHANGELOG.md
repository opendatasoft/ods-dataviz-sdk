# [21.0.0](https://github.com/opendatasoft/ods-dataviz-sdk/compare/@opendatasoft/api-client@21.1.0-beta.0...@opendatasoft/api-client@21.0.0) (2023-06-26)

Welcome to the first stable release of `@opendatasoft/api-client`!

This MAJOR release is meant to coincide with [Opendatasoft's Explore API v2.1](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-explore-v2/explore_v2.1.html) release and includes a few new features.

**New clauses**: Clauses help you build ready to use [ODSQL predicates](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-explore-v2/explore_v2.1.html#section/ODSQL-predicates).
- The `textStartWith()` function is for a search where the searched string matches text fields that contain strings beginning with the searched string. Equivalent to [ODSQL startsWith](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-explore-v2/explore_v2.1.html#section/ODSQL-predicates/startswith()).
- The `textSuggest()` function is for a search where the searched string matches the text fields that contain individual terms beginning the searched string. Equivalent to [ODSQL suggest](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-explore-v2/explore_v2.1.html#section/ODSQL-predicates/suggest()).
- The `textSearch()` function is for fuzzy searches that find matches even if the searched string is not an exact match. Equivalent to [ODSQL search](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-explore-v2/explore_v2.1.html#section/ODSQL-predicates/search()).

All theses clauses accept a second optional parameter (`textFields` : `string[]`) to specify the fields to search in. By default the search is done on all the fields.

**Deprecation warnings**: When an API response contains the `ODS-Explore-API-Deprecation` header, by default, a warning message will be showed in the console.
It can be disabled by setting up the `hideDeprecatedWarning` option to `false` when initiating the Client.
To learn more about deprecation warnings, follow this [link](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-explore-v2/explore_v2.1.html#section/Versioning/Deprecation-warnings).

**Better TS support for exports functions**: `ExportCatalogFormat` and `ExportDatasetFormat` list available export formats for a catalog or a dataset.

## üÜô Upgrade guide
- The `query()` function has been removed. Use the `records()` function instead. ‚ö†Ô∏è danger Response format has also changed.
- Previously deprecated, the `aggregates()` function has been removed. Use the `records()` function instead.
- Response format for the `records()` query has changed. `links` has been removed and `record` replaced by `results`.
- Response format for the `datasets()` query has changed. `dataset` has been replaced by `results`.
- The `textSearch()` clause has been renamed to `textSuggest()`. ‚ö†Ô∏è `textSearch()` still exists but is now a clause to do a fuzzy search that finds matches even if the searched string is not an exact match. Equivalent to [ODSQL search predicate](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-explore-v2/explore_v2.1.html#section/ODSQL-predicates/search()).
- The `exports()` function have been renamed to `export()`.
- `XLS` export format is removed and changed to `XLSX`.
