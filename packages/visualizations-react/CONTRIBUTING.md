## Build

This project uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) as a bundler through [TSDX](https://tsdx.io/api-reference).

To watch this package:

```bash
npm run watch # or yarn run watch
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

Then run either Storybook or the example playground:

### Storybook

Run inside another terminal:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This loads the stories from `./stories`.

## Configuration

Code quality is set up for you with `prettier`, `husky`, and `lint-staged`.

## Jest

Jest tests are set up to run with `npm test` or `yarn test`.

You can also have test coverage with `npm run test:coverage`. And rerun test as you work with `npm run test:watch`.

## Bundle Analysis

[`size-limit`](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) with `npm run size` and visualize the bundle with `npm run analyze`.

## Optimizations

Please see the main `tsdx` [optimizations docs](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx#optimizations). In particular, know that you can take advantage of development-only optimizations:

```js
// ./types/index.d.ts
declare var __DEV__: boolean;

// inside your code...
if (__DEV__) {
    console.log('foo');
}
```

## Module Formats

CJS, ESModules, and UMD module formats are supported.

The appropriate paths are configured in `package.json` and `dist/index.js` accordingly. Please report if any issues are found.

## Named Exports

Per Palmer Group guidelines, [always use named exports.](https://github.com/palmerhq/typescript#exports).
